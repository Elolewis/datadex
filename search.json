    "text": "🤔 What is Datadex?\n\n\n\nCI\n\n\nDatadex explores how people could collaborate on Open Data using the principles and tooling from the Modern/Open Data Stack. Using tools like dbt and DuckDB you can transform data by simply writing select statements or importing someone else’s model.sql and building on top of it!\n\n💡 Features\n\nOpen: Play well with the rest of the ecosystem.\nModular: Each tool can be replaced and extended (adapters). Works well in many environments.\nFlexible. Run it from your laptop, in a cluster, or from the browser.\nData as Code. Version your data as code thanks to dbt! Publish and share your models for other people to build on top of them. Data, reproducible and accessible!\nModern: Supports types, tests, materialized views, and more. Don’t build new tools to work with Open Data, build bridges with the existing ones."

Get things working end to end with the following steps:\n\nSetup dependencies with make deps.\nBuild your dbt models and save them to Parquet files with make run.\nExplore the data with make rill.\n\n\n\n\nrill"
